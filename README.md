# CardBoard

CardBoard is an open-source project to build a multiplayer collectable-card-game with units that move freely on a battlefield. 
The name is a terrible pun; the game has cards, and its played on a board.

The core tech-stack is Java8(Fx) with Python used for scripting, and Maven for our build automation. If you are interested in contributing please drop us a message.
