Cards in this directory need to be:

1. Playtested
2. Json files checks for errors (e.g no melee units with range please)
3. Sprite/Animation checks
4. Check Description (card text should accurately describe how cards work in project cardboard, not how they worked in Duelyst)

Once confirmed good, move them from this directory to the cards to import dir, and commit that change to master branch.
