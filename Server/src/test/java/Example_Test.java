/**
So this file is a very quick practical guide to unit-testing.

 Here are a few conventions I would like us to follow:
 1) All tests belong in the src/test.java folder.
 2) All test classes should end with "_Test".
 3) All test classes should start with the name of class that they are testing.
 4) Try to name tests such that when they fail, it is obvious what went wrong.
 5) Try to get into the habit of running 'mvm clean package test'.

public class Example_Test {

    @Test // All individual tests require @Test in order for the test runner to pick it up.
    public void TwoPlusTwoIsFour() { // all tests should be set to Public and return nothing.
        // Notice that the test name makes it clear what we are testing.

        int expected = 4;
        int actual = 2 + 2;

        // If we all get in the habit of using the 'expected' and 'actual' terminology it
        // should be easy to write tests that are easily understandable.

        // The test...
        Assert.assertEquals("Optional error message", expected, actual);
    }

    @Test
    public void SevenIsLessThanThree() {

        boolean actual = 7 < 3;
        boolean expected = false;

        Assert.assertEquals("Optional error message", expected, actual);

        // Although the above will work, when testing booleans its often better to get rid of 'expected'
        // and call assertTrue/assertFalse instead. Like so:

        Assert.assertFalse("Optional error message", actual);
    }
